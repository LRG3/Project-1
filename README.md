•	Project Name - Beach Out!

•	Team Members - Jarred Wheet, Malorie Wright, Phongsavanh Xayvongsack (Sushi), and Robert Gonzalez

•	Application Description – Beach Out! is an ILS application for hotel business owners who need an increase in revenue and occupancy. The application will generate a random “Beach Get Away” itinerary for spontaneous travelers seeking the perfect adventure. Beach Out! will log the end-users email before the “Beach Get Away” itinerary generates. We will send the lead information from the application database for a monthly membership fee to the hotel owners. The higher the membership fee paid, the more times the hotels name will populate on the website to drum up more traffic. Beach Out! is a business solution for troubled tourist locations.
